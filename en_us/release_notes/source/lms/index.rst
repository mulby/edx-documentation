  for the content experiment groups and cohorts to which students belong.
  (TNL-498)

* When a pagination button is visually disabled, the button is now also
  disabled for screen readers. (TNL-997)

* When students checked their answers to a custom response problem with 10 or
  more inputs, the responses were not sorted correctly. This problem is
  resolved. (TNL-952)

* For numerical response problems, if the tolerance was set to greater than
  0.1, answers that varied from the correct answer by an amount equal to the
  tolerance were marked incorrect; that is, the correct answer was no inclusive of the tolerance setting. This problem is resolved. (TNL-904)

* In the Instructor Dashboard, when you unenrolled a student who enrolled in
  the Verified track, if that student was re-enrolled, he or she was
  automatically placed in the Verified track.  This problem is fixed; the
  student is no longer automatically enrolled in the Verified track. (ECOM-776)

* The Student Dashboard is updated to provide a visual indication of
  professional education courses the student is enrolled in. (ECOM-728)
