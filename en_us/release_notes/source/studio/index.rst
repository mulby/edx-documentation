* When a component with multiple parents had a draft version, you received an
  error when trying to export the course. This problem is resolved. (PLAT-332)

* You can now use a new advanced setting, ``always_cohort_inline_discussions``,
  to control whether content-specific discussion topics are unified or
  cohorted.  See `Make All Content-Specific Discussion Topics Unified by
  Default`_ for more information.

* The inline help for the **Discussion Topic Mapping** advanced setting is
  updated to note that discussion IDs must be unique. (TNL-752)
